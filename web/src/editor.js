   THE BENCH REMEMBERS ITSELF

     "instead of providing the mod file and save json every time i open
      it. it will work more like an app. ill need to put that in the
      seperate folder and it will update things inside with what i
      provide and auto use those so when i restart my PC i can just
      continue straight away."

   So: everything you do is written back the moment you do it, and
   opening the page picks up exactly where you left off. No save to
   pick, no mod zip to re-feed, nothing to remember.

   WHERE IT IS KEPT. In the browser's own store, under this page. Two
   of them, in order:

     IndexedDB    first, because there is no practical size limit and a
                  bench with a dozen pictures in it is megabytes.
     localStorage second, when IndexedDB is refused - about five
                  megabytes, which is enough for the numbers and a few
                  pictures and not enough for many.

   ...and if both are refused - a private window, a browser told to
   keep no site data - the bench says so in the corner and goes on
   working exactly as it did before, with the save file as the only
   memory. It never pretends to have saved something it did not.

   WHAT IS KEPT is what "Save project" writes: the items, the
   numbers, the layouts, the drop settings, your notes, and only the
   pictures you replaced. The mod's own three megabytes of config are
   NOT kept, because this page already has them baked in - unless you
   have fed it a NEWER mod than the one it was built with, which is the
   one case where they are.

   THE SAVE FILE IS NOT GONE and is not second best. This store belongs
   to one browser on one computer; the file is the copy you send me,
   send your friend, or put somewhere safe. Both are here on purpose.

     always refreshed the mod's FILES and never reconciled the LISTS -
     so a container that no longer exists sat there being built into
     every zip, and one of those zips would not start the game. See the
     note in boxSystem: a borrowed section it cannot find is a section
     it used to invent.

     WHAT IS SAFE TO DROP IS NARROW, because this is somebody's work:

       borrowed, and gone from the seed   the game's own section that
                                          this mod no longer touches.
                                          It was never ours to keep.
       ours, not new, not adopted,        a container the mod itself
       and gone from the seed             retired.

     ANYTHING YOU MADE OR ADOPTED IS NEVER TOUCHED, whether or not the
     mod has heard of it - that is the whole point of making one.

   HOW THE PICTURE SITS IN ITS CELLS

      in the ZoneBench with visual how it will look in game kinda. like
      add grid behind the texture user uploads and add options to size
      it up and down."

   Exactly that. The drawing is laid on a grid of the item's own cells,
   at the size and place the sheet will actually put it, and there are
   handles to change it.

   THE NUMBERS ARE RELATIVE, not pixels: a zoom about the centre and a
   nudge as a fraction of the rectangle. So they go on meaning the same
   thing when you make the item a cell wider, and they do not depend on
   how big the PNG happens to be.

   WHAT A RIG IS MADE OF

   as well as in the file, because everybody assumes they are:

     what it is made of      the components the workbench lets you

                             on a cell, and swapping a worn one is the
                             second way to mend a rig - the first being
                             a repair kit.

     what it breaks down     what dismantling GIVES BACK. Every entry
     into                    is created, one each; it is not a pool to
                             roll from.

   The rules on the first are the game's, from the head of parts.ltx:
   at most six, every one different, and every one a conditional item -
   which the prt_i_* hardware is not. The second has no such rules;

   WHAT A POUCH COSTS TO BUILD

     "also add crafting editor to pouches and optional for adopted
      pouches"

   A rig's recipe is worked out and shown; there is no editing it,
   because the derivation IS the balance - a rig costs what it would
   cost to reach that shape by bolting pouches onto a strap.

   A pouch is the bottom of that ladder. Nothing is sold that a pouch
   is made of, so there is nothing to derive from and the recipe is
   simply a recipe. Hence a real editor: the kit you must be carrying,
   the book you must have read, and up to four things it eats.

   FOUR IS THE CEILING AND IT IS NOT ADVISORY. ui_workshop parses each
   line into at most four ingredients and DROPS THE WHOLE RECIPE if
   there are more, saying nothing - so the fifth row is refused here
   rather than in a workshop that silently forgets the pouch exists.

   Exactly right, and it was information: the rig card printed the
   derivation as a table and the only way to disagree with it was a note
   in prose for me to read later. One editor now, for both.

   THE DERIVATION IS STILL THE BALANCE. A rig's recipe is worked out

   A RULE IS SHARED. Two containers that name the same rule are two

   picture, it takes up room in your bag, it costs money and it can be
   built at a workshop. The only thing that makes it a backpack is that
   it ALSO has an inside - a grid it gives you when you put it on.

   So there is one editor. The Backpacks tab is that editor plus one
   card; the Item editor tab is that editor without it.

   ADOPT, MINUS THE PART THAT MAKES A THING OURS. An adopted rig BECOMES
   this mod's rig - our keys, our install route, our refusal to sit in a
   pouch slot. An edited item is still exactly what it was. It has a

   NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS ASKED FOR. It was the one part of this bench

   WHOLE FILE: there is no DLTX for menus, so whichever mod ships one
   last wins it entire, and half a dozen mods in a GAMMA install ship
   one. A bench that cannot write that file cannot break anybody's menu
   by accident - which is also why there used to be two html files, one
   with the editor and one without. There is one now, and it is the
   safe one.

   The functions the BUILD used to ask - is there a layout, does it need
   a sheet, a background picture - are answered here, once, with no.
   Kept as answers rather than deleted so that the build's own code is
   untouched by this removal: a file it never writes is a file that

     THE LAYOUT, AND WHY THE PLAIN BENCH DOES NOT WRITE ONE

     THIS ZIP IS A PATCH, NOT A WHOLE MOD - its own Build page says so:
     "drop it over the Squared Away you already have ... nothing else in
     your install is touched". The mod ships its layout again, and a
     build that does not mention it leaves the one already on disk
     exactly where it is. That is the behaviour, not an omission.

     A draft of this carried the mod's copy through "so a build could
     not lose it" - and that would have been the plain bench quietly
     overwriting a layout the layout-editor bench had just written.
     A patch that rewrites a file nobody asked it to touch is not a
